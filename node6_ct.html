<P>
When 
<A NAME="tex2html25" HREF="http://www.tcptrace.org" TARGET="_top"><SPAN  CLASS="textit">tcptrace</SPAN></A>
is run trivially on a dumpfile, it generates output similar
to the following :

Beluga:/Users/mani&gt; tcptrace tigris.dmp

1 arg remaining, starting with 'tigris.dmp'
Ostermann's tcptrace -- version 6.4.5 -- Fri Jun 13, 2003

87 packets seen, 87 TCP packets traced
elapsed wallclock time: 0:00:00.037900, 2295 pkts/sec analyzed
trace file elapsed time: 0:00:12.180796
TCP connection info:
  1: pride.cs.ohiou.edu:54735 - elephus.cs.ohiou.edu:ssh (a2b)        30&gt;   30&lt;  (complete)
  2: pride.cs.ohiou.edu:54736 - a17-112-152-32.apple.com:http (c2d)   12&gt;   15&lt;  (complete)
</PRE>

<P>
In the above example, 
<A NAME="tex2html26" HREF="http://www.tcptrace.org" TARGET="_top"><SPAN  CLASS="textit">tcptrace</SPAN></A>
is run on dumpfile <TT>tigris.dmp</TT>.  The
initial lines tell that the file 
<A NAME="tex2html27" HREF="http://www.tcptrace.org" TARGET="_top"><SPAN  CLASS="textit">tcptrace</SPAN></A>
is processing currently 
is <TT>tigris.dmp</TT>, the version of 
<A NAME="tex2html28" HREF="http://www.tcptrace.org" TARGET="_top"><SPAN  CLASS="textit">tcptrace</SPAN></A>
running, and
when it was compiled.
The next line tells that a total of 87 packets were seen in the dumpfile and
all the 87 TCP packets (in this case) were traced. The next
line tells that the <TT>elapsed wallclock time</TT> 
i.e., the time 
<A NAME="tex2html29" HREF="http://www.tcptrace.org" TARGET="_top"><SPAN  CLASS="textit">tcptrace</SPAN></A>
took to
process the dumpfile, and the average speed in packets per second taken for
processing. The following line indicates the <TT>trace file elapsed
time</TT> i.e., the duration of packet capture of the dumpfile calculated as the 
duration between the capture of the first and last packets.

<P>
The subsequent lines indicate the two TCP connections traced from the
dumpfile. The first connection was seen between machines 
<TT>pride.cs.ohiou.edu</TT> at TCP port <TT>54735</TT>, 
and <TT>elephus.cs.ohiou.edu</TT> at TCP port <TT>ssh</TT> (22). Similarly
the second connection was seen between machines <TT>pride.cs.ohiou.edu</TT>
at TCP port <TT>54736</TT>, and <TT>a17-112-152-32.apple.com</TT> at TCP port 
<TT>http</TT> (80).

<A NAME="tex2html30" HREF="http://www.tcptrace.org" TARGET="_top"><SPAN  CLASS="textit">tcptrace</SPAN></A>
uses a labeling scheme to refer to individual connections traced.
In the above example the two connections are labeled <TT>a2b</TT> and 
<TT>c2d</TT> respectively.
For the first connection, 30 packets were seen in the a2b direction 
(pride.cs.ohiou.edu ==<MATH CLASS="INLINE">
&gt;
</MATH> elephus.cs.ohiou.edu) and 30 packets were
seen in the b2a direction (elephus.cs.ohiou.edu ==<MATH CLASS="INLINE">
&gt;
</MATH> pride.cs.ohiou.edu).
The two connections are reported as <TT>complete</TT> indicating that the
entire TCP connection was traced i.e., SYN and FIN segments opening and
closing the connection were traced. TCP connections may also be reported as
<TT>reset</TT> if the connection was closed with an RST segment, or
<TT>unidirectional</TT> if traffic was seen flowing in only one direction.

<P>
The above brief output generated by 
<A NAME="tex2html31" HREF="http://www.tcptrace.org" TARGET="_top"><SPAN  CLASS="textit">tcptrace</SPAN></A>
can also be generated with the
<TT>-b</TT> option. In the above example, 
<A NAME="tex2html32" HREF="http://www.tcptrace.org" TARGET="_top"><SPAN  CLASS="textit">tcptrace</SPAN></A>
looked up names
(elephus.cs.ohiou.edu, for example) and service names (http, for example)
involving a DNS name lookup operation.
Such name and service lookups can be turned off with the <TT>-n</TT> option
to make 
<A NAME="tex2html33" HREF="http://www.tcptrace.org" TARGET="_top"><SPAN  CLASS="textit">tcptrace</SPAN></A>
process faster. If you need name lookups but would rather
have the short names of machines (<TT>elephus</TT> instead of 
<TT>elephus.cs.ohiou.edu</TT> for example), use the <TT>-s</TT> option.
