Throughput Graph 
</H1> 
Throughput graphs (named X2Y_tput.xpl) are generated with the
<TT>-T</TT> option. A sample throughput graph is shown in Figure <A HREF="node13_ct.html#tput">5.9</A>.

<P>

<DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="tput"></A><A NAME="670"></A>

</TABLE>
</DIV>

<P>
The graph has throughput in bytes/second on the Y-axis and time on the X-axis.

<P>

<UL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Yellow Dots</SPAN> represent instantaneous throughput, defined as the
size of the segment seen divided by the time since the last segment was seen
(in this direction).
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Blue Line</SPAN> tracks the average throughput of the connection
up to that point in the life time of the connection (total bytes seen / total
seconds so far).
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Red Line</SPAN> tracks the throughput seen from
the last few samples, calculated as the average of N previous yellow dots.
By default the line tracks the past 10 samples (N=10). However it can be
changed with the <TT>-AN</TT> option. For example giving <TT>-A5</TT> along
with the <TT>-T</TT> option calculates the throughput from the past 5 yellow
dots to draw the line.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Due to clock granularity, there tends to be a lot of
banding of the dots. If you find the yellow dots annoying, you may turn them 
off with the <TT>-y</TT> option.
