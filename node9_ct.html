RTT Stats 
</H1>
RTT (Round-Trip Time) statistics are generated when the <TT>-r</TT> option is
specified along with the <TT>-l</TT> option (Section <A HREF="node8_ct.html#sec:_Long_Output">4.1</A>).
The following fields of output are produced along with the output generated
by the <TT>-l</TT> option.

<UL>
<LI><TT>RTT samples</TT> The total number of Round-Trip Time (RTT) samples 
found. 
<A NAME="tex2html35" HREF="http://www.tcptrace.org" TARGET="_top"><SPAN  CLASS="textit">tcptrace</SPAN></A>
is pretty smart about choosing only valid RTT samples. An 
RTT sample is found only if an ack packet is received from the other endpoint
for a previously transmitted packet such that the acknowledgment value is 1
greater than the last sequence number of the packet. Further, it is required
that the packet being acknowledged was not retransmitted, and that no packets 
that came before it in the sequence space were retransmitted after the packet 
was transmitted. Note : The former condition invalidates RTT samples due to
the retransmission ambiguity problem, and the latter condition invalidates
RTT samples since it could be the case that the ack packet could be
cumulatively acknowledging the retransmitted packet, and not necessarily
ack-ing the packet in question.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>RTT min</TT> The minimum RTT sample seen.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>RTT max</TT> The maximum RTT sample seen.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>RTT avg</TT> The average value of RTT found, calculated
straightforward-ly as the sum of all the RTT values found divided by the
total number of RTT samples.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>RTT stdev</TT> The standard deviation of the RTT samples.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>RTT from 3WHS</TT> The RTT value calculated from the TCP 3-Way
Hand-Shake (connection opening) [<A HREF="node42_ct.html#ISI81" TARGET="contents">2</A>], assuming that the SYN packets of 
the connection were captured.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>RTT full_sz smpls</TT> The total number of full-size RTT samples, 
calculated from the RTT samples of full-size segments. Full-size segments
are defined to be the segments of the largest size seen in the connection.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>RTT full_sz min</TT> The minimum full-size RTT sample.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>RTT full_sz max</TT> The maximum full-size RTT sample.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>RTT full_sz avg</TT> The average full-size RTT sample.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>RTT full_sz stdev</TT> The standard deviation of full-size RTT
samples.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>post-loss acks</TT> The total number of ack packets received after
losses were detected and a retransmission occurred. More precisely, a
<TT>post-loss ack</TT> is found to occur when an ack packet acknowledges a
packet sent (acknowledgment value in the ack pkt is 1 greater than the
packet's last sequence number), and at least one packet occurring before the 
packet acknowledged, was retransmitted later. In other words, the ack packet
is received after we observed a (perceived) loss event and are recovering
from it.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>ambiguous acks, RTT min, RTT max, RTT avg, RTT sdv</TT> These
fields are printed only if there was at least one ack received that was
ambiguous due to the retransmission ambiguity problem i.e., the segment
being ack-ed was retransmitted and it is impossible to determine if the ack
is for the original or the retransmitted packet. Note that these samples are
not considered in the <TT>RTT samples</TT> explained above. The statistics
below are calculated from the time of capture of the last transmitted instance
of the segment.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>ambiguous acks</TT> is the total number of such ambiguous acks seen.
The following <TT>RTT min, RTT max, RTT avg, RTT sdv</TT> fields represent
the minimum, maximum, average, and standard deviation respectively of the
RTT samples calculated from ambiguous acks.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>segs cum acked</TT> The count of the number of segments that were
cumulatively acknowledged and not directly acknowledged.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>duplicate acks</TT> The total number of duplicate acknowledgments
received. An ack packet is found to be a duplicate ack based on this
definition used by 4.4 BSD Lite TCP Stack [<A HREF="node42_ct.html#WS96" TARGET="contents">10</A>] :

<P>
o The ack packet has the biggest ACK (acknowledgment number) ever seen. 
<BR>
o The ack should be pure (carry zero tcp data payload). 
<BR>
o The advertised window carried in the ack packet should not change from the
last window advertisement. 
<BR>
o There must be <SPAN  CLASS="textit">some</SPAN> outstanding data.
<BR>
<P>
Note : older versions of 
<A NAME="tex2html36" HREF="http://www.tcptrace.org" TARGET="_top"><SPAN  CLASS="textit">tcptrace</SPAN></A>
(until version 6.4.2) used a legacy
algorithm using just the first condition amongst the four listed above, 
to treat an ack as duplicate ack.
This older behavior may be emulated (if necessary at all) with the
<TT>--turn_off_BSD_dupack</TT> option.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>triple dupacks</TT> The total number of triple duplicate
acknowledgments received (three duplicate acknowledgments acknowledging
the same segment), 
a condition commonly used to trigger the fast-retransmit/fast-recovery
phase of TCP.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>max # retrans</TT> The maximum number of retransmissions seen for
any segment during the lifetime of the connection.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>min retr time</TT> The minimum time seen between any two 
(re)transmissions of a segment amongst all the retransmissions seen.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>max retr time</TT> The maximum time seen between any two
(re)transmissions of a segment.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>avg retr time</TT> The average time seen between any two
(re)transmissions of a segment calculated from all the retransmissions.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>sdv retr time</TT> The standard deviation of the
retransmission-time samples obtained from all the retransmissions.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The raw <TT>RTT samples</TT> found can also be dumped into data files with 
the <TT>-Z</TT> option as in 
<PRE>
tcptrace -Z file.dmp
</PRE>

<P>
This generates
files of the form a2b_rttraw.dat and b2a_rttraw.dat (for both directions of the
first TCP connection traced), c2d_rttraw.dat and d2c_rttraw.dat (for the
second TCP connection traced) etc. in the working directory.
Each of the datafiles contain lines of the form :
<PRE>
seq#    rtt
</PRE>
where <TT>seq#</TT> is the sequence number of the first byte of the segment
being acknowledged (by the ack packet that contributed this RTT sample) and
<TT>rtt</TT> is the RTT value in milli-seconds of the sample. Note that only
valid RTT samples (as counted in the <TT>RTT Samples</TT> field listed above)
are dumped.
