Warning Control 
</H1>
This section describes the options that control the
printing of warning messages on various events. These options are turned off
by default and you need to turn them on to be notified.
You may also use the <TT>-w</TT> option to turn on all of the following
options.

<P>

<UL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">--warn_ooo</SPAN> Warn if packet capture timestamps are found to be
out of order in the dumpfile. For example, if the dumpfile is of
<TT>tcpdump</TT> style,
this option would cause a warning message if the PCAP timestamps of successive
packets were found decreasing.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">--warn_printtrunc</SPAN> Warn if a packet captured was found too
short to analyze i.e., if either the basic TCP header(20 bytes) for TCP
packets or the UDP header (8 bytes) for UDP packets was not fully captured.
Note that, this warning message typically means that the packet capture was
not done requesting enough of every packet to be captured. With
<TT>tcpdump</TT> for example, this can be fixed with a suitable value to 
the <TT>-s</TT> snaplen option.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">--warn_printbadmbz</SPAN> (Warn Bad Must Be Zero) Prints a warning
message if any of the 4 least significant bits in the 13th byte of the header 
(that are reserved and expected to be zeroed) are found to be non zero.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">--warn_printhwdups</SPAN> Warn if hardware duplicates (that commonly
indicate link-level retransmissions) were found for IPv4 packets.
Hardware duplicates are defined to be the IPv4 packets
with the same TCP sequence number and the 16-bit IPv4 identification number 
of a previously seen packet.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">--warn_printbadcsum</SPAN> This option needs to be given along with
the <TT>-checksum</TT> option, and prints the packet numbers of the packets
in the dumpfile that had bad IP and TCP/UDP checksums. The following example
illustrates this :

<P>
<PRE>
alakhian@spider:% tcptrace --warn_printbadcsum --checksum input/bad_tcp_checksum.dmp.gz
packet 1: bad TCP checksum
1 arg remaining, starting with 'input/bad_tcp_checksum.dmp.gz'
Ostermann's tcptrace -- version 6.2.6 -- Thu Nov 14, 2002

10 packets seen, 9 TCP packets traced
elapsed wallclock time: 0:00:00.057058, 175 pkts/sec analyzed
trace file elapsed time: 0:00:00.012379
bad IP checksums:  0
bad TCP checksums: 1
TCP connection info:
  1: analex093.lerc.nasa.gov:2270 - chipper.lerc.nasa.gov:139 (a2b)    3&gt;    6&lt;
</PRE>

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">--warn_printbad_syn_fin_seq</SPAN> Prints a warning if the SYN or
FIN segments were retransmitted with a different sequence number from their
original transmissions.
</LI>
