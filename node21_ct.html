Advanced Filtering 
</H1>

<P>
The <TT>-f</TT> option can be used to perform more sophisticated filtering of
connections, based on various parameters. 
The supported filter variables are listed below :

</PRE>

<P>
All of the variables listed above can be used for filtering purposes.

<P>
For example, consider the file <TT>tigris.dmp.gz</TT> having the following two
connections:

<P>
<PRE>
Beluga:/Users/mani&gt; tcptrace tigris.dmp.gz
. . .
TCP connection info:
  1: pride.cs.ohiou.edu:54735 - elephus.cs.ohiou.edu:ssh (a2b)        30&gt;   30&lt;  (complete)
  2: pride.cs.ohiou.edu:54736 - a17-112-152-32.apple.com:http (c2d)   12&gt;   15&lt;  (complete)
</PRE>

<P>
The filter variable <TT>segs</TT> can be used to filter out connections
having a specified amount of segments in either direction as shown below.

<P>
<PRE>
Beluga:/Users/mani&gt; tcptrace -f'segs&gt;=30' tigris.dmp.gz
Output filter: ((c_segs&gt;=30)OR(s_segs&gt;=30))
1 arg remaining, starting with 'tigris.dmp.gz'
. . .
TCP connection info:
  1: pride.cs.ohiou.edu:54735 - elephus.cs.ohiou.edu:ssh (a2b)   30&gt;   30&lt;  (complete)
</PRE>

<P>
Note the <TT>Output filter</TT> line in the above example. The term 
c_segs stands for the client segs (client2server direction) and s_segs
stands for the server segs (server2client direction).
We filter out only those connections that had at least 30 or more segments seen
in either direction. You may specify the segments in the server2client
direction alone as in :

<P>
<PRE>
Beluga:/Users/mani&gt; tcptrace -f's_segs==15' tigris.dmp.gz
Output filter: (s_segs==15)
. . .
TCP connection info:
  2: pride.cs.ohiou.edu:54736 - a17-112-152-32.apple.com:http (c2d)   12&gt;   15&lt;  (complete)
</PRE>

<P>
The ``<TT>c_</TT>'' and ``<TT>s_</TT>'' prefixes can be applied analogously
for all the filter variables cited above. The prefix ``<TT>b_</TT>'' meaning
``both'' can be applied to the variables if you want the filter to be
applied to both directions. For the sake of completeness, the prefix
``<TT>e_</TT>'' meaning ``either'' is also supported, requiring the filter
variable to be applied to either of the directions (which is of course the
default case). 

<P>
Boolean variables listed above can be used as
flags as in 

<P>
<PRE>
tcptrace -f'f1323_ws' file.dmp
</PRE>
to filter out only those connections that had window scaling requested in
their SYN segments.

<P>
The constant value to which the STRING type variables (hostname/portname)
are matched need to be enclosed in double quotes. The following example
illustrates the case when we are filtering out connections for the host
<TT>elephus.cs.ohiou.edu</TT> and port <TT>ssh</TT>.

<P>
<PRE>
Beluga:/Users/mani&gt; tcptrace -f'hostname=="elephus.cs.ohiou.edu" and portname=="ssh"'
tigris.dmp.gz
Output filter: (((c_hostname==elephus.cs.ohiou.edu)OR
(s_hostname==elephus.cs.ohiou.edu))AND((c_portname==ssh)OR(s_portname==ssh)))
. . .
TCP connection info:
  1: pride.cs.ohiou.edu:54735 - elephus.cs.ohiou.edu:ssh (a2b)   30&gt;   30&lt;  (complete)
</PRE>

<P>
Note that as in the example above, commonly used boolean operators AND, OR,
NOT and their common synonyms (-a, -o, &amp;&amp;, ||, !) can be used to combine
boolean expressions. You may also use parenthesis if you are not sure of the
precedence of operators. Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) with their normal
precedence and relational operators ( &lt;, &gt;, =, !=, &lt;=, &gt;= ) can be applied
to SIGNED/UNSIGNED variables. 
For example, the following are valid :

<P>
<PRE>
tcptrace -f`(c_segs+10) &lt; s_segs' file.dmp
tcptrace -f`b_segs&gt;10 &amp;&amp; thruput&gt;10000' file.dmp
</PRE>

<P>
The connection numbers that passed the filtering criteria specified in the
<TT>-f</TT> option are stored in a file named <TT>PF</TT> in the working
directory. Note that, if you are graphing along with the <TT>-f</TT> option
with say the <TT>-G</TT> option, graphs will be generated for all the
connections and not just the filtered ones. You might want to filter first
with the <TT>-f</TT> option and graph the filtered connections with the
<TT>PF</TT> file later, as in :

<P>
<PRE>
tcptrace -oPF -G file.dmp
