reports statistics on the estimated congestion window with the
<TT>-W</TT> option when used in conjunction with the <TT>-l</TT> option.
Since there is no direct way to determine the congestion window at the TCP
sender, the outstanding unacknowledged data is used to estimate the congestion
window. The 4 new statistics produced by the <TT>-W</TT> option in addition to
the detailed statistics reported due to the <TT>-l</TT> option, are 
explained below.

<UL>
<LI><TT>max owin</TT> The maximum outstanding unacknowledged data (in
bytes) seen at any point in time in the lifetime of the connection.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>min non-zero owin</TT> The minimum (non-zero) outstanding
unacknowledged data (in bytes) seen.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>avg owin</TT> The average outstanding unacknowledged data (in
bytes), calculated from the sum of all the outstanding data byte samples (in
bytes) divided by the total number of samples.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>wavg owin</TT> The weighted average outstanding unacknowledged
data seen. For example, if the outstanding data (odata) was 500 bytes for
the first 0.1 seconds, 1000 bytes for the next 1 second, and 2000 bytes for
the last 0.1 seconds of a connection that lasted 1.2 seconds, <TT>wavg
owin</TT>= ((500 x 0.1) + (1000 x 1) + (2000 x 0.1)) / 1.2 = 1041.67 bytes an
estimate closer to 1000 bytes which was the outstanding data 
for the most of the lifetime of the connection. Note that the
straight-forward average reported in <TT>avg owin</TT> would have been
(500+1000+2000)/1.2 = 2916.67 bytes, a value less indicative of the
outstanding data observed during most of the connection's lifetime.
