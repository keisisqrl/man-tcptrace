Preface 
</H1>

<P>
The goal of this manual is to document the 
<A NAME="tex2html3" HREF="http://www.tcptrace.org" TARGET="_top"><SPAN  CLASS="textit">tcptrace</SPAN></A>
program; to explain how to
get it installed, explain its capabilities, how to get it do all it can do, 
what all the output it generates mean, and how they are calculated, etc.
However, the goal is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">not</SPAN> to explain the working of the
TCP/IP protocol suite itself, and there are nice books that do this already. I
recommend my favorite book [<A HREF="node42_ct.html#Stevens94" TARGET="contents">7</A>] if you need to understand
the TCP/IP protocol suite better, or if commonly used TCP/IP parlance like 
``SACK'', ``CWND'', ``pure ACK'' etc., are not familiar to you.

<P>
The manual is organized into chapters with the goal of making them as modular
as possible so that they can be read independently of one another. 
It consists of the following chapters : 

<P>

<UL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Getting Started</SPAN> Explains how to get 
<A NAME="tex2html4" HREF="http://www.tcptrace.org" TARGET="_top"><SPAN  CLASS="textit">tcptrace</SPAN></A>
up and running
on your system, and the details from the environment that 
<A NAME="tex2html5" HREF="http://www.tcptrace.org" TARGET="_top"><SPAN  CLASS="textit">tcptrace</SPAN></A>
uses.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Basic Usage</SPAN> Explains the basic output generated by 
<A NAME="tex2html6" HREF="http://www.tcptrace.org" TARGET="_top"><SPAN  CLASS="textit">tcptrace</SPAN></A>
.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Detailed Usage</SPAN> Explains how to perform more detailed analysis,
and the fields in the long output format.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Graphing</SPAN> Explains the graphs that can be generated, and how
to generate them.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Filtering Connections</SPAN> Explains how to filter-out or filter-in
the connection(s) of interest.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Extended Options</SPAN> Explains what each of the extended options
mean and how to turn them on/off.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Miscellany</SPAN> Explains all the miscellaneous things the
program can do, like minimal UDP analysis, printing out packet details, etc.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Modules</SPAN> Explains the behavior of the modules distributed with

<A NAME="tex2html7" HREF="http://www.tcptrace.org" TARGET="_top"><SPAN  CLASS="textit">tcptrace</SPAN></A>
, and briefly on how to write your own modules.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
If you are a 
<A NAME="tex2html8" HREF="http://www.tcptrace.org" TARGET="_top"><SPAN  CLASS="textit">tcptrace</SPAN></A>
Power-user familiar with the program, and are just 
looking for the option that generates the output you need, you might dive 
straight into Appendix <A HREF="node38_ct.html#ch:_argQR">A</A>: Arguments Quick Reference. 
You may find answers to some of your 
<A NAME="tex2html9" HREF="http://www.xplot.org" TARGET="_top"><SPAN  CLASS="textit">xplot</SPAN></A>
related questions in 
Appendix <A HREF="node39_ct.html#ch:_xplotQR">B</A>: XPLOT Quick Reference. 
The syntactical definitions of common protocol headers are provided in 
Appendix <A HREF="node40_ct.html#ch:_protocolQR">C</A> Protocol Quick Reference.

<P>
Finally, in a slight abuse of parlance, the terms ``segments'' and
``packets'' have been used interchangeably in the manual. However it would
be clear from context, for e.g., if we say ``TCP packets'' we mean 
``TCP segments''. Hopefully it would not be a cause of concern.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Thanks</SPAN>

Thanks are due to my friend Avinash S. Lakhiani for working on
an earlier version of the manual and for getting the Documentation project
kick-started. Some sections of the manual have been drawn directly from his
manuscript. Thanks are also due to the Python Software Foundation for the 
 style files from the Python Documentation Project used for generating 
this manual.
