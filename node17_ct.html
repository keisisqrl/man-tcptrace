Time-Line Graph 
</H1>
The goal of the Time-Line graphs is to generate graphs similar to the pretty 
graphs found in the book ``TCP/IP Illustrated Volume I'' by W. Richard Stevens
[<A HREF="node42_ct.html#Stevens94" TARGET="contents">7</A>], illustrating the activities of connections.
The graphs can be generated with the <TT>-L</TT> option and generates graphs
named as X_Y_tline.xpl

<P>
The Time-Line graphs are still EXPERIMENTAL and are under development.
The fundamental problem with generating these graphs is that
the time values for the segments arriving/leaving are available only from
the end where the traffic was captured, while the time values of when the 
packets arrived or left at the other end have to be estimated with some
heuristic. Doing this <SPAN  CLASS="textit">right</SPAN> tends to be a hard problem taking care
of conditions like retransmits, timeouts etc. 
The current heuristic is a simple one of adding/subtracting 1/3rd of the rtt. 

<P>
This graph provides a pictorial view of the segments
being transmitted in either direction, over the duration of the connection.
The Y-axis shows increasing time going from the top to bottom of the graph.
The X-axis shows the segments being transmitted between the 2 hosts
communicating. As you zoom in with xplot, more and more details will become
visible. Here is an example of a time line graph:

<DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="tline1"></A><A NAME="723"></A>
<TABLE>

Following is a closeup (zoomed in with xplot):

The following features can be seen in the graph
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Axis</STRONG></DT>
<DD>X-axis : segments being transmitted in either direction (zoom in to see the
 arrow heads for the correct direction) 

<P>
Y-axis : running time of the connection (TOP to BOTTOM, ignoring the
 negative sign)

<DT><STRONG>Graph Features</STRONG></DT>

<DD>The green lines show the segments traveling in the direction a-&gt;b

<P>

<DT><STRONG>Labels</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The labels alongside the segments have the following format:

<P>
TCP Flags (only if set), 
   sequence_number_from:sequence_number_to(difference, bytes transmitted), 
   acknowledgment_sequence_number, 
   advertised window, 
   retransmit indicator (``R''), 
   hardware duplicate indicator (``HD'') 

<P>
The sequence number for the first segment in either direction is
   absolute, while the rest are relative to the first segment.
