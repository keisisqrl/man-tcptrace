Miscellany

If you want to generate all the graphs, use the <TT>-G</TT> option.
If you want monochrome plots, use the <TT>-M</TT> option. For the sake of
completeness, the <TT>-C</TT> option produces color plots (which of course is 
the default behavior).

<P>
In all the above graphs, the X-axis represents the actual time of the
connection. If you want relative time with time beginning at 0, use the
<TT>-zx</TT> option while generating the graphs. The Y-axis can also be made
to begin from 0 with the <TT>-zy</TT> option. This is generally useful in
Time Sequence graphs, where the sequence offset rather than the actual
sequence number values may be desired. Figure <A HREF="node12_ct.html#tsg4">5.4</A> shows a section of a 
Time Sequence graph generated with <TT>-zxy</TT> option, causing both the axes 
to begin from 0.

<P>
If you would rather have the graphs generated be placed in a separate
directory, and not clutter your working directory, use the
<TT>-output_dir</TT> option. For example, 

<P>
<PRE>
tcptrace -G --output_dir=graphs indica.dmp
</PRE>

<P>
would leave all the graphs in the <TT>graphs</TT> directory. 

<P>
Now, if you are using the same <TT>graphs</TT> directory to store the graphs 
generated from another file <TT>mangifera.dmp</TT>, the old *.xpl files from 
<TT>indica.dmp</TT> may get over-written by the new *.xpl files. You may
wish to use the <TT>-output_prefix</TT> option to fix this. For example,

<P>
<PRE>
tcptrace -G --output_dir=graphs --output_prefix=mangifera_ mangifera.dmp
</PRE>

<P>
would generate files of the form <TT>mangifera_a2b_tsg.xpl</TT> in the
<TT>graphs</TT> directory.

<P>

can also call xplot internally to pop-up the graphs generated at
the end of processing the dumpfile(s) with the
<TT>-xplot_all_files</TT> option. For example,

<P>
<PRE>
tcptrace -S --xplot_all_files elephus.dmp
</PRE>
This would pop-up all the Time Sequence graphs generated for the dumpfile 
<TT>elephus.dmp</TT>, which could be a lot depending on the number of
connections found. This option is meant for use when there are a few
connections in the dumpfile, unless you want your screen to be filled with
xplot graphs. While using this option, any options that need to be given to
xplot for drawing the graphs can also be specified with the
<TT>``-xplot_args=. . .'' </TT> option, where the <TT>``. . .''</TT> is the
place-holder for any xplot options to be set, while calling xplot internally
from 
<A NAME="tex2html59" HREF="http://www.tcptrace.org" TARGET="_top"><SPAN  CLASS="textit">tcptrace</SPAN></A>
. 
If multiple options are being passed to xplot, it is recommended
that the entire option be enclosed in double quotes as shown above,
to protect it from being interpreted as multiple command-line arguments by 
your Shell.

<P>
A user-defined prefix may be added to the title of the xplot graphs if
necessary, by passing the prefix in the 
<TT>-xplot_title_prefix=''...''</TT> option.
